        When you encounter a mushroom, its species will be highlighted and a box
        will expand to show a record of your experiences with that species. As
        you choose whether or not to eat mushrooms, they will be sorted into
        groups based on the outcome. In addition, your bonus for the experiment
        will go up or down based on your actions.
    </p>

		    If you eat a healthy mushroom a <span style="color: lime">green</span>,
		    upward-pointing triangle will appear, and you will <strong> gain
		    $0.02</strong>. If you eat a poisonous mushroom a <span style="color:red">
		    red </span> downward-pointing triangle will appear, and you will
		    <strong> lose $0.02</strong>. If you don't eat a mushroom, a
        <span style="color: gray">gray</span> circle will appear, and you will
        not gain or lose any money.
