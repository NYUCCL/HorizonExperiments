# Varying-horizon Approach-avoid decision-making experiments

Code to run "mushroom-foraging" games testing people's sensitivity to the future
value of information in finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings.

There are four experiments total - one in each folder. All experiments are run
using the [psiTurk experiment framework](http://psiturk.org/).

Before running the experiment online, please be sure to update
`templates/ad.html` and `templates/consent.html`.
