        As you choose whether or not to eat mushrooms, they will be sorted into groups and change
        color to record your progress. In addition, your bonus for the experiment
        will go up or down based on your actions.

        If you eat a healthy mushroom, the circle will become a <span
      style="color:lime">green</span>, upward triangle and you will <strong> gain $0.02
      </strong>. If you eat a poisonous mushroom the circle will become a <span
      style="color:red">red</span>, downward triangle and you will <strong> lose $0.02</strong>.
      If you don't eat a mushroom, the circle will become <span style="color:gray">
          gray</span>, indicating that you do not know whether the mushroom was
      healthy or poisonous. You will not gain or lose money when you don't eat a mushroom.
